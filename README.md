# PiggyBank

CS300 (UW-Madison) Project #1 -- Piggy Bank

Application that represents a piggy bank. Similar to a bag that hold coins but with minimal organization

Defines mainly the following operations: You can...

1) add a coin to the piggy bank.
2) get the balance of your piggy bank.
3) remove an arbitrary coin from the piggy bank (in real life scenario, you can shake the bank, so you have no control over what coin falls out).
4) remove all coins from your piggy bank.

Learning Objectives:

1. practicing the use of control structures, custom static methods, and using arrays in methods.
2. practicing how to manage an unordered collection of data that may contain duplicates (multiple occurrences of the same element),
3. learning how to develop tests to demonstrate the functionality of code, and familiarizing yourself with CS300 grading tests.
